## Random Facts

### Robot Models

- ChronoTech has released a few robot models, namely:
    - **Cybrix**: servicebots manufactured from the 1980s up until the 2000s
      that has since been discontinued
    - **Flux**: military-focused robots that have been in production since the
      1990s
    - **Spark**: modern servicebots in production since the year 2016

- In addition, ChronoTech has also developed unreleased robot models:
    - The Boiler
    - Chrome

### ChronoTech

- ChronoTech is a technology organisation of assembled hobbyist researchers and
  engineers with the goal of bringing innovative inventions to life, most of
  which are related with time-travelling.
- The ChronoTech facility is a relatively small building, comparable to the
  size of an average American school. However, the rest of the facility is
  hidden within a pocket dimension which is accessible through a gateway
  underneath the very floorboards. This pocket dimension enables boundless
  amounts of land for the ChronoTech facility, allowing them to perform
  colossal experiments.
    - The mainline series takes place in that pocket dimension.
    - While the pocket dimension was impressive, it also meant that ChronoTech
      was potentially in violation of various real estate laws, forcing them to
      keep it a secret.

### SC

- SC is based on Cybrix, a model originally intended for service work
- SC was taken away from ChronoTech along with other robots and reprogrammed
  for a life of crime
- ChronoTech eventually recaptured SC and confined the robot hidden in a
  storage facility within a pocket dimension, erasing all of its memory
