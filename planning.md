# Planning

This file contains facts/lore that are already finalized, so there only exists
a small quantity of information now. There are tad bits of old lore I'm not
proud of, stored in a google doc (which was honestly a mistake in and of
itself) 

Also this file has spoilers, so be careful if you haven't seen the story yet.

## Random Facts

### Robot Models

- ChronoTech has released a few robot models, namely:
    - **Cybrix**: servicebots manufactured from the 1980s up until the 2000s
      that has since been discontinued
    - **Flux**: military-focused robots that have been in production since the
      1990s
    - **Spark**: modern servicebots in production since the year 2016

- In addition, ChronoTech has also developed unreleased robot models:
    - **The Boiler**: Originally designed for heating-related tasks such as
      boiling, cooking, and stewing, the Boiler robot now serves a much darker
      purpose. It has been repurposed as an executioner, its combustion chamber
      located underneath its torso used to scorch victims alive. The ChronoTech
      artificial security is the one who issues the commands, directing the
      Boiler with a cold and calculating precision.
    - **Chrome**

### ChronoTech

- ChronoTech is a technology organisation of assembled hobbyist researchers and
  engineers with the goal of bringing innovative inventions to life.
- The ChronoTech facility is a relatively small building, comparable to the
  size of an average American school. However, the rest of the facility is
  hidden within a pocket dimension which is accessible through a gateway
  underneath the very floorboards. This pocket dimension enables boundless
  amounts of land for the ChronoTech facility, allowing them to perform
  colossal experiments.
    - The mainline series takes place in that pocket dimension.
    - While the pocket dimension was impressive, it also meant that ChronoTech
      was potentially in violation of various real estate laws, forcing them to
      keep it a secret.
- ChronoTech has developed a time-travelling portal in line with their original
  goals of creating time-related technology.
    - They initiated a demonstration of the portal for the President, who
      brought his bodyguards along with him.
    - During the demonstration, the portal was functioning as normal, opening a
      gateway to a point in time inputted by the controlling researcher.
    - However, halfway into the demonstration, the researcher attempted to
      input a point of time far into the future.

### SC

- SC is based on Cybrix, a model originally intended for service work
- SC was taken away from ChronoTech along with other robots and reprogrammed
  for a life of crime
- ChronoTech eventually recaptured SC and confined the robot hidden in a
  storage facility within a pocket dimension, erasing all of its memory
