Apocalyptic Invasion

"The story of a lone robot in the shadows of a
forbidding facility."

Background

Apocalyptic Invasion is sort of a personal project I've
been wanting to make for a very long time. I think the
initial concept of Apocalyptic Invasion has potential, so
I decided to build upon the idea and make something up.
