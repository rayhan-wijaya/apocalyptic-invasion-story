 Apocalyptic Invasion

_"The story of a lone robot in the shadows of a
forbidding facility."_

Background

Apocalyptic Invasion is sort of a personal project I've
been wanting to make for a very long time. I think the
initial concept of Apocalyptic Invasion has potential, so
I decided to build upon the idea and make something up.

The Future of Apocalyptic Invasion

I want Apocalyptic Invasion to have a couple side stories
in the form of miniseries. There would be more books
created, not just the main series. That's why the main
series' latex file is put under its own directory.

One of the miniseries would be a diary written by
a character of the main series that'll be written in
first person. And most of the miniseries would be
focusing on elements of the main series that aren't
touched on too much.
