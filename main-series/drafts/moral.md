# Moral

The moral of Apocalyptic Invasion is to keep a close attention to maintaining
your moral when pursuing an end goal. In this story, the end goal for SC is
freedom. To escape the facility.

But during that process, SC antagonized her allies and everyone around her in
the desolate facility, oftenly resorting to violence to resolve issues. SC's
reserved personality caused her to misunderstand the intentions and feelings of
the people around her. Her timidity prevented her to connect with these people
and understand them as genuine people with thoughts and feelings.

When SC realized this, it was all already too late. She had succeeded her goal,
but the damage she left behind left served as a reminder for her everyday. She
eventually succumbed to her guilt and did what she knew was best for her.
