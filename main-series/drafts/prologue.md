# Prologue

- In a dimly lit room, ...
- In the far corner, a robot was lying dormant on a metallic table, slowly
  succumbing to rust.
- As the robot remained there, she was cut off from the world around her.
- Without the ability to see or hear, the robot was left alone with her
  thoughts, pondering the nature of her existence and why she was created.

- ...

- And before she realized, the air was thick with a foul smell, accompanied by
  the clenching sounds of metal tongs.
- The robot suddenly sensed faint whispers that seemed to be coming faraway.
- Feeling uneasy, she slowly opens her lens, only to be blinded by a shine of
  light.
- The robot attempted to make a sound, but was unable to produce any audible
  output.
- As she struggled, a strange silhoutte approached her from the opposite end of
  the room.
