\section*{Prologue}

In a dimly lit room, a robot layed dormant on a metallic table. As the robot
remained there, she was cut off from the world around her. Without the ability
to see or hear, the robot was left alone with her thoughts, pondering the
nature of her existence and why she was created.

...

The air was thick with a foul smell, accompanied by the clenching sounds of
metal tongs. After a moment, The robot suddenly sensed faint whispers that
seemed to be coming faraway.

Feeling uneasy, the robot slowly opens her lens, only to be blinded by a shine
of light. The robot attempted to make a sound, but was unable to produce any
audible output.
