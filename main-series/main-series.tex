\section*{Prologue}

\section*{Chapter 1}

In a dimly lit room, ...

In the far corner, a robot was lying dormant on a metallic table, slowly
succumbing to rust. As the robot remained there, she was cut off from the world
around her. Without the ability to see or hear, the robot was left alone with
her thoughts, pondering the nature of her existence and why she was created.

...

And before she realized it, the air was thick with a foul odor, accompanied by
the clenching sounds of metal tongs. The robot suddenly sensed faint whispers
that seemed to be coming faraway.

Feeling uneasy, the robot slowly opens her lens, only to be blinded by a shine
of light. The robot attempted to make a sound, but was unable to produce any
audible output.

As she struggled, a strange silhoutte approached her from the opposite end of
the room.
