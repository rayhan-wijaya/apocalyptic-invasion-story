\section*{Prologue}

In a dimly lit room, a robot layed dormant on a metallic table. As the
robot remained there, she was cut off from the world around her.
Without the ability to see or hear, the robot was left alone with her
thoughts, pondering the nature of her existence and why she was
created.
