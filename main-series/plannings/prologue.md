# Prologue

## Low-Level Version

- In a dimly lit room, a robot layed dormant on a metallic table.
- The air was thick with a foul smell, accompanied by the clenching sounds of
  metal tongs.
- The robot suddenly sensed faint whispers that seemed to be coming faraway.
- Feeling uneasy, the robot slowly opens her lens, only to be blinded by a
  shine of light.
- Beneath all the radiance, the robot could barely discern the shape of an
  individual.
- The robot attempted to make a sound, but was unable to produce any audible
  output.
